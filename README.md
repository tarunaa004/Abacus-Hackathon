# Abacus-hackathon
This project serves as a platform to enable a connect between industry professionals and students aspiring to achieve a strong grounding in industry-oriented problems. It is an idea swapping platform were prospective employers pose real time problems and tasks from their functioning work environments, and students, either in teams or individually propose solutions to these problems within a stipulated time period. Employers can choose from the host of solutions provided to inculcate in their projects enabling a ranking system through which suitable candidates are recognised from the student pool.
